# Sudoku

A way to solve sudokus you've found elsewhere. Work in progress.

## Currently

You can input your problem by clicking the input button. The cells you've input then will show up green, so you can distinguish them from the cells you've added. 

## Future

* Check if cells could be correct, given what already exists
* Not allow green cells to be changed outside of input mode
* Have application solve the sudoku, and add "hint" button
     * Add "guess and check" mode, where any wrong answer will be flagged, instead of just things that don't fit with current cells
* Fix bug where anything can be clicked and made yellow
* Better styling
* Message when correctly solved
